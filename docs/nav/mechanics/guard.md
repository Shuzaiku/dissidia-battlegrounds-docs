# Guard

## Introduction
Guarding is a mechanic that allows you to negate damage from certain attacks as long as the attack is landed within 180Â° of the character's field of view. This operation is calculated through dot product.

Characters may guard when whenever they aren't stunned, but you can manually set whether or not they can guard for specific scenarios as well.

## How it works

#### Allowing/disallowing guard
```lua
ServerUtils.canGuard(character: Model, canGuard: boolean)
```

| character: Model  | The character whose `CanGuard` attribute will be changed. |
